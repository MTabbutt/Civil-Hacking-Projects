Middleton issue with police - see police report - issues with consistency 


# Ideas:

18,000 agencies in the country - can we evaluate who is good and not? Who needs to be gutted?

- Duty to intercede with an officer excessive force 

- Other metrics to grade a station on? Give everyone a grade, 

- measure transparency 

- Access to demographics data for undergrads, who takes the classes. 

- Jim Williams - Pipeline things for demographics about when people drop off. 

- Bus project - Evan - Catalysts for Science Policy 



- Berkley - Jupyter hub - data science center
