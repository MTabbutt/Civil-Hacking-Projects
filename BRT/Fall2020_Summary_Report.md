 ## Route Spacing - Route Balancing Considerations
 
Initial tinkering with spacing: 

Process: Look at all weekday routes possible: "92_WKDX' where X are different perameters specified by Madison Metro. For every route, look at every possible trip during the week. For each trip find all of the distances between stops. Create one, massive, array with all of these distances. Then plot the mean, and quartiles as seen below.

### Mean of all Weekday Trips:
